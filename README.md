# Social Media Analysis Using Graph Theory for Viral Marketing

## Chapter 1: Introduction

### 1.1 General Introduction
Social media platforms have become an integral part of our daily lives, generating massive datasets of interactions between users. Analyzing these datasets is crucial for various purposes, including marketing, user engagement, and understanding the dynamics of information dissemination. This project outlines a comprehensive approach to social media analysis using graph theory, with a focus on influence maximization. We will utilize Python's inbuilt frameworks, particularly NetworkX, to perform this analysis and display the results on a website.

This demo walks you through the steps of uploading a CSV file, selecting an influence maximization algorithm, setting parameters, and visualizing the influence spread. It also covers interpreting the outputs including the video illustration, network graphs, and summary tables.

#### 1.1.1 Influence Maximization (IM)
Influence maximization is a vital problem in social network analysis. It aims to identify a subset of individuals (nodes) in a social network that can maximize the spread of influence, such as information, ideas, or trends. This concept has applications in viral marketing, public health campaigns, and social network analysis.

#### 1.1.2 Graph Theory
Graph theory is a mathematical discipline that deals with the study of graphs, which consist of nodes (vertices) and edges (connections). In the context of social networks, nodes represent users, and edges represent relationships or interactions between users. Graph theory is used to represent the social network as a mathematical graph, where users or entities are represented as nodes, and their connections or interactions are represented as edges.

### 1.2 Problem Statement
The problem is to develop a sophisticated social media analysis framework that leverages influence maximization strategies to enhance marketing effectiveness. This framework should address critical challenges including identifying influential users, selecting optimal initial seed nodes, modeling message propagation, allocating marketing budget, and measuring actual propagation. Solving this problem will enable businesses to maximize marketing impact and achieve their goals efficiently in the dynamic landscape of social media.

### 1.3 Significance & Novelty of the Problem

### 1.4 Brief Description of the Solution Approach
The solution approach involves creating a Flask web application for influence maximization on network graphs. The program utilizes three algorithms (Greedy, Degree Centrality, and PageRank) to identify influential nodes. It incorporates NetworkX for graph manipulation, matplotlib for visualization, and Flask for web development. The application allows users to upload a CSV file representing the graph, select an algorithm, set parameters, and visualize the influence maximization process. Outputs include a video illustrating the spread of influence, graphs depicting network dynamics, and tables summarizing influential nodes and connections. The solution aims to provide a user-friendly interface for studying influence dynamics in networks.
