3.3. Solution Approach
This application is a web-based tool for performing influence maximization on a given graph
using various algorithms. The influence maximization problem aims to identify a set of seed
nodes in a network that maximizes the spread of influence, often modeled using the
independent cascade model[1].
The program implements three influence maximization algorithms: Greedy, Degree Centrality,
and PageRank.
● Greedy Algorithm
The Greedy algorithm is a simple and intuitive approach to solve optimization problems. It
makes locally optimal choices at each stage with the hope of finding a global optimum[2].
The idea is to make the best decision at each step without considering the consequences of
that decision on future steps. In the context of influence maximization, the Greedy algorithm
is used to find a set of seed nodes in a social network to maximize the spread of influence
[2]. It’s implementation can be explained in the following steps –


Explanation:
1. Initialization:
♦ seed_nodes: An empty list to store the selected seed nodes.
♦ image_counter: A counter for naming the generated PNG images.
2. Greedy Selection Loop (for _ in range(k)):
For each iteration (selecting k seed nodes):
♦ Initialize max_node and max_influence for tracking the node with
the maximum influence.
♦ Iterate over all nodes in the graph (graph.nodes()).
♦ For each non-selected node, create a copy of the current seed nodes
(temp_seed_nodes) and add the current node.
♦ Use the independent_cascade_model function to calculate the
influence of adding the current node to the seed nodes.
21
♦ If the calculated influence is greater than the current maximum
influence, update max_node and max_influence.
♦ After the loop, add the selected max_node to the list of seed_nodes.
3. Visualization and Image Generation:
♦ Visualize the current state of the graph with different node colors
representing seed nodes, influenced nodes, and non-active nodes.
♦ Save the visualization as a PNG image with a filename based on the
iteration number.
4. Return Result:
♦ Return the final list of selected seed_nodes.
This function performs the core logic of the Greedy algorithm. It iteratively selects nodes
that maximize the immediate influence, visualizes the current state of the graph, and
saves images for each iteration. The returned seed_nodes represent the final set of nodes
selected by the Greedy algorithm.
● Degree Centrality Algorithm:
Degree centrality is a measure of the importance of a node in a graph based on the number of
connections it has. In other words, nodes with higher degree centrality are those that are
more connected to other nodes in the network [1]. The degree centrality of a node is
calculated by dividing the number of edges connected to the node by the total number of
nodes in the graph.
The degree centrality algorithm in the program aims to select seed nodes for influence
maximization based on their degree centrality in the graph [1]. Here's how the algorithm is
implemented –


Explanation:
I. Initialization:
♦ influence_nodes: A set to keep track of nodes influenced by the
selected seed nodes.
♦ seed_nodes: A list to store the selected seed nodes.
♦ image_counter: A counter to keep track of iterations for visualization.
II. Main Loop (Seed Selection):
♦ The function iterates k times to select k seed nodes.
♦ Inside the loop, it initializes variables (max_node and max_degree)
to keep track of the node with the highest degree centrality and its
degree.
III. Degree Centrality Selection:
♦ It iterates over all nodes in the graph and checks if the node has not
been selected as a seed (node not in seed_nodes) and has a higher
degree centrality (degree > max_degree).
♦ If so, it updates max_degree and max_node.
IV. Seed Nodes Update:
23
♦ The node with the highest degree centrality (max_node) is added to
the list of seed nodes (seed_nodes).
V. Influence Update:
♦ The neighbors of the selected node are added to the set of influenced
nodes (influence_nodes).
VI. Visualization:
♦ The visualize_graph function is called to create a visualization of the
current state of the graph with colored nodes representing seed nodes,
influenced nodes, and non-active nodes.
VII. Iteration Counter Update:
♦ The image_counter is incremented for the next iteration.
VIII. Return:
♦ The function returns the final list of seed nodes and the set of
influenced nodes.
This algorithm aims to select seed nodes based on their degree centrality, and it
visualizes the influence maximization process at each step.
● Page Rank Algorithm
The PageRank algorithm is an algorithm used by search engines to rank web pages in their
search engine results. It was developed by Larry Page and Sergey Brin, the founders of
Google. The basic idea behind PageRank is that a page is important if it is linked to by other
important pages [1]. It assigns a numerical weight to each element of a hyperlinked set of
documents, such as the World Wide Web, with the purpose of measuring its relative
importance within the set. The algorithm is iterative, and the importance of a page is
influenced not only by the number of links to it but also by the importance of the pages
linking to it. [2]


Explanation:
I. Initialization:
♦ influence_nodes: A set to keep track of nodes influenced by the
selected seed nodes.
♦ seed_nodes: A list to store the selected seed nodes.
♦ image_counter: A counter to keep track of iterations for visualization.
II. Iteration (k times):
For each iteration (selecting k seed nodes):
♦ Initialize variables to track the node with the maximum PageRank and
its corresponding PageRank score.
♦ Iterate over nodes in the graph and their PageRank scores.
♦ Select the node with the highest PageRank that is not already a seed
node.
♦ Add the selected node to the seed nodes.
♦ Update the influence nodes with the neighbors of the selected node.
25
♦ Visualize the current state of the graph.
III. Return:
♦ Return the final list of seed_nodes and the set of influence_nodes.
The pagerank_algorithm function implements the PageRank algorithm to select a set of seed nodes for
influence maximization. It iteratively chooses nodes with the highest PageRank, updates the seed nodes
and influence nodes, and visualizes the graph at each iteration [1]. The final result is a set of seed nodes
that are expected to maximize influence in the network.

5.4. Error and Exception Handling
Error and exception handling is crucial to ensure the robustness of the program. Here are some
aspects of error and exception handling in this program:
i. Error Handling in Flask Routes:
In the Flask routes ('/process' and '/get_video'), there is some basic error handling
using try-except blocks. If an exception occurs during the execution of the route, it will
catch the exception and respond accordingly.

Code Snippet:
Fig. 32
Fig. 33

ii. File Handling:
When reading and saving files, there is a basic error check to ensure that the required
files exist. For example, the program checks if images and video files exist before
attempting to remove them.
This can be enhanced by handling specific file-related exceptions and providing
meaningful error messages.

iii. Algorithm Execution:
Inside the perform_influence_maximization function, the selected influence
maximization algorithm is executed inside a try-except block. If an exception occurs
during the algorithm's execution, it can be caught and handled appropriately.

iv. Error Page Rendering:
In case of an exception, the program renders an 'error.html' template. Ensure that this
template provides meaningful information about the error for debugging purposes.

5.5. Limitations of the solution
The intended solution which has been implemented in the program has some limitations and
areas that could be improved:
1. Security Concerns:
The code doesn't implement sufficient security measures. For example, file uploads
should be validated to ensure they are of the expected format and not malicious. Input
validation and sanitization should be performed to prevent common security issues like
SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS).
2. Lack of Support for generating data for a mega dataset:
The influence maximization algorithms used (Greedy, Degree Centrality, and PageRank)
are basic and might not be suitable for large datasets.
3. Graph Visualization:
The graph visualization is generated as a series of images, which might not scale well
for large graphs or many iterations.
4. Algorithms and Performance:
The influence maximization algorithms used (Greedy, Degree Centrality, and PageRank)
are basic and might not be suitable for large graphs. More advanced algorithms or
optimizations could be explored for better performance and accuracy.
